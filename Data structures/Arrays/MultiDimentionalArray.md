Multi-dimensional arrays, particularly matrices, are a fundamental concept in computer science and programming, especially for roles involving data manipulation, algorithms, and scientific computing. Let's break this down into manageable parts to help you prepare efficiently for your interview.

## Understanding Multi-dimensional Arrays

A multi-dimensional array is an array of arrays. The two-dimensional array, or matrix, is the most common, where you can visualize it as rows and columns.

## Declaration Examples:

In Swift: 
var numericalGrid: [[Int]] = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
]

## Basic Matrix Operations

- Addition and Subtraction: You can add or subtract two matrices if they have the same dimensions. Add or subtract corresponding elements.

- Multiplication:
    - Scalar Multiplication: Multiply every element in the matrix by a scalar value.
    - Matrix Multiplication: The product of matrices A (size m x n) and B (size n x p) results in a new matrix C (size m x p). The element at position C[i][j] is computed as the dot product of the i-th row of A and the j-th column of B.

- Transpose: The transpose of a matrix is a new matrix whose rows are the columns of the original.

- Determinant and Inverse (mostly applicable to square matrices): These are more complex operations, often used in linear algebra to solve systems of linear equations.

## Traversal Patterns

Traversing a matrix means visiting every element once. Common traversal patterns include:

- Row-wise Traversal: Loop through each row and within that loop, go through each column.

- Column-wise Traversal: Loop through each column and within that loop, go through each row.

- Diagonal Traversal: There are two main diagonals. For the primary diagonal, elements satisfy the condition row index = column index. The secondary diagonal can be traversed by iterating through elements where row index + column index = size of matrix - 1.

- Spiral Traversal: Start from the outer layer and progressively move towards the center, rotating direction at the edges.
