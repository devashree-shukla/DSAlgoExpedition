Floyd's Tortoise and Hare is a cycle detection algorithm often used in data structures and algorithms (DSA) to identify the presence of a cycle in a sequence of values, such as in a linked list. The beauty of this algorithm lies in its efficiency and simplicity; it uses two pointers moving at different speeds (one faster, one slower) to traverse the sequence. If there is a cycle, they are guaranteed to meet.

For finding the entry point of a cycle in a linked list, the algorithm is generally implemented in two main phases:

- Detection Phase: Determine if a cycle exists in the linked list.

- Finding Entry Point Phase: Find the node where the cycle begins.

How It Works:
Cycle Detection: The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If there's a cycle, they will meet inside the cycle at some point.

Finding Entry Point: Once a meeting point inside the cycle is found, we reset the slow pointer to the head of the list and keep the fast pointer at the meeting point. Then, both pointers move one step at a time. The point where they meet again is the entry point of the cycle.

This algorithm is a fundamental concept in computer science for dealing with cyclic structures and is highly efficient with a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1), making it suitable for large datasets where minimizing memory usage is critical.
