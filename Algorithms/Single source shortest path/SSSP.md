| Feature | Dijkstra's Algorithm | Bellman-Ford Algorithm |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Basic Principle** | Greedily selects the nearest unvisited vertex. | Systematically relaxes all edges, considering potential longer paths that could lead to a shorter solution. |
| **Edge Weight Restrictions** | Only works with graphs that have non-negative edge weights. | Can handle negative edge weights and can detect negative weight cycles. |
| **Time Complexity** | O(V^2) for simple implementation, O(V+E log V) with min-priority queue (e.g., Fibonacci heap). | O(VE), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. |
| **Space Complexity** | O(V), as it needs to keep track of the visited vertices and the current shortest path to each vertex. | O(V), for storing distances and predecessors. |
| **Optimization** | Highly optimized for graphs without negative weights. | Less efficient than Dijkstraâ€™s for graphs without negative weights but essential for graphs with negative weights. |
| **Usage** | Suitable for maps and spatial data, routing algorithms where paths do not have negative weights. | Suitable for financial models, network routing algorithms where paths might have negative costs, and detecting arbitrage opportunities. |
| **Algorithm Type** | Greedy algorithm. | Dynamic programming algorithm. |
| **Path Reconstruction** | Easier and more straightforward, as paths are determined by the greedy selection of the shortest edges. | Requires additional steps to reconstruct the path, especially if there are negative weight edges. |
| **Negative Cycle Detection** | Cannot detect negative cycles; assumes all weights are non-negative. | Can detect negative cycles, which is crucial for certain applications like financial trading systems. |
