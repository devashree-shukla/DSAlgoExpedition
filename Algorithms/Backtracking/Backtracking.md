- Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, and removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time. 
- It is especially useful for solving constraint satisfaction problems like puzzles, combinatorial problems, and parsing.

Key Concepts of Backtracking

## Choice

At each step, you make a choice out of a number of possible options. If the choice leads to a solution, you continue forward; otherwise, you backtrack and choose another path.

## Constraints

Rules that must be followed for a solution to be considered valid. If a choice violates a constraint, it must be rejected and another choice must be made.

## Goal

The condition that must be reached to consider the problem solved. The algorithm stops when the goal is achieved.

## Steps in Backtracking

- Choose: Select an option to explore.
- Constrain: Check if the current choice violates any constraints. If so, reject this choice and go back (backtrack) to the previous step.
- Goal: Check if the goal has been reached. If so, the current solution is valid.
- Backtrack: If the goal hasn’t been reached or the choice leads to a dead end, backtrack to explore new paths.

## When to Use Backtracking

Backtracking is particularly useful when the number of possible configurations is enormous and it’s impractical to try each one individually, but the problem space can be divided into a smaller space.

## Examples of Backtracking Problems

- N-Queens Problem: Place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
- Sudoku Solver: Fill in a partially filled Sudoku grid according to the rules of Sudoku.
- Permutations and Combinations: Generate all possible combinations or permutations of a set of numbers.

## Example: N-Queens Problem in Swift

The N-Queens problem asks you to place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. A solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
