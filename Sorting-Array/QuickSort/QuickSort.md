Quicksort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm that, when implemented well, can be significantly faster than other sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort for large datasets. It follows the divide and conquer strategy to sort an array (or list), which involves three main steps:

## Divide (Partitioning): 

The array is partitioned into two sub-arrays based on a pivot element such that elements less than the pivot are on its left, and elements greater than the pivot are on its right. The pivot element itself is in its final position. This step is the key to the Quicksort algorithm. The choice of the pivot can affect the performance of the algorithm. Common strategies for choosing a pivot include picking the first element, the last element, the median, or a random element of the array.

## Conquer: 

Recursively apply the above process to the sub-arrays formed by the partitioning step. This means that Quicksort is applied to the sub-array to the left of the pivot and the sub-array to the right of the pivot.

## Combine: 

As the Quicksort algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, the 'combine' step does not require any work. Once the conquer step is completed, all elements are sorted.

## Properties

### Time Complexity: 

The average and best-case time complexity of Quicksort is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. 

The worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), which occurs when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot. However, this is rare, especially with good pivot selection strategies.

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity of Quicksort is O(log n) due to the stack space used for recursion. However, this can degrade to O(n) in the worst case.

**Not Stable:** It does not maintain the relative order of equal elements.
**In-place:** It sorts the array without using extra space, except for the stack space used for recursion.

## Interview Tips:

- Understand the algorithm deeply, including its best, average, and worst-case scenarios.
- Practice coding Quicksort from scratch, focusing on choosing a good pivot and handling edge cases.
- Be prepared to discuss the space and time complexity of the algorithm.
- Understand how Quicksort compares to other sorting algorithms and when to use it.

Quicksort is widely used because of its efficiency and simplicity, especially for large datasets. Being familiar with its implementation and characteristics can be a great asset during technical interviews.
